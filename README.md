# kkill
a simple process killer by name

simply kkill program1 program2 ...

will send a kill signal to all processes running that match the parameters

depending on your system, change const char psflags and PROCESSPOSITION, PROGRAMPOSITION

as it is now, it is configured for Ubuntu/Debian. I have no plans on expanding the code
